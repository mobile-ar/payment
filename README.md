# Payment
Payment challenge

# Proyect
Open `payment.xcworkspace` because this proyect uses CocoaPods.

# Used Pods
* [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya): For Network abstraction layer in Swift. (Compile-time checking for correct API endpoint accesses, lets you define a clear usage of different endpoints with associated enum values., treats test stubs as first-class citizens so unit testing is super-easy.) 

* [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON): makes it easy to deal with JSON data in Swift. 

* [AlamofireImage](https://github.com/Alamofire/AlamofireImage): Image Response Serializers + an lot more.

# Things to improve
[] Unit Test
[] UI Test
[] Reachability (no error message for no internet connection)
[] Image chache
